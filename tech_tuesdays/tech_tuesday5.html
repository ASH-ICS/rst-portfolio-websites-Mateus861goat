      <td style="color:#E85A4F;"> GTA 6 is one of the most highly unticipated games of all time, with gamers from all over the world waiting for its release for a long time. The game was announced to be being worked on  in February 4, 2022 via twitter, but since then, no additional information has been shared with the public, and the release date for the game is still unknown..  
        Last year a nuch of GTA 6 footage has been leaked all over the internet forcing Rock star to take action and remove all early development footage from the internet. The leaks contained the GTA 6 pre alpha state and showed some of the brand new characters and locations, but other data is still unknown.
        . In an article by Bloomberg, published in June 2022 a former Rock start employe estimated that the release was estimated to happen in about 2 years, but this is unconfirmed as there could be potential draw backs. 
        GTA 6 is expected to run primarily on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as they have ran in the past. 
          Last september, what was described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of the video game industry happened to GTA 6. A user by the name of teapotubehacker leaked about 90 videos in the official GTA forum, which contained early in development gameplay footage. After the post blew up, the hacker tried to set up a deal with Rockstar and Take-Two to take down the videos he posted. The videos were deleted by the original user who posted them, but can still be found throoughout the internet.
        Rockstar hasn’t confirmed where the GTA 6 story line will take place but there’s a lot of rumors, gossips and predictions floating around. It seems as if the GTA 6 setting will take place in Vice City (Rockstar’s virtual version of Miami), that's backed up by the leaked gameplay footage, one of which showed a “Vice City Metro” train. According to an ex-worker of Rockstar Games, at the start of the development, there were areas in the game modeled after both South and North America, but apparently it was cut back so that the devs could focus on Vice City’s surrounding areas, though "the game’s world remains large, with more interior locations than previous Grand Theft Auto games". But the map wont remain static. According to the report, the map wont remain static, as the developers aim to make regular updates to missions, locations and the map. The idea of this is to take off pressure from the developers during the developing phase and to transfer it to the active game phase. This promises to shorten the wait for the game and keep it interesting after it is released.
        To conclude, we do not know exactly when the game will be released, but we can expect it to be around 2 years of wait. The in game location will be Miami, or “Vice CIty”, and the game will have way more interior locations than the previous version. Missions, Objectives and locations will be continuously updated as the game is released. Lastly, the storyline is gonna be completely knew and promises to make the game very interesting.
