      <td style="color:#E85A4F;">Recently, researchers have been conducting innovative research on a device known as a Solar Tower Power Plant, invented in 1981 by Spanish engineers. This device was not widely adopted because of the cost and how big the device was. Additionally this power plant has a limited energy production and only works during the daytime. Throughout the years there have been slight improvements to it, but nothing significant enough to popularize the model. However, researchers from Qatar and Jordan have achieved better results by implementing downdraft technology to the plant.
        The power plant can now generate electricity during the day and the night, as air from daytime sunlight retains heat, said the researchers. After testing the plant, it was estimated that the energy generated in one year was around the amout energy needed to power about 753 homes for nearly five weeks. TTSS, they say, consists of an updraft tower of about 652 ft height and a 45-foot diameter with 10 downdraft towers circling the updraft tower.
