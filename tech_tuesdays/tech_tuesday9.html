      <td style="color:#E85A4F;">Apple is currently making a big effort to respond to the fast rise of artificial intelligence in the tech industry. The company, historically somewhat passive in this area, found itself left behind as OpenAI's ChatGPT gained fame. Google and Microsoft, in the meantime, launched AI powered search engines capable of generating human-like responses, while Microsoft enhanced its Windows applications with more intelligent virtual assistants. Meanwhile, all Apple's did was create an improved spell-check system in iOS 17. 
        Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, acknowledges that the company has been engaged in AI development for an extended period. However, Apple's executives were evidently taken by surprise when AI suddenly gained so much momentum, leading to an effort to make up for lost time since late last year. This has created a lot of anxiety in the company and a recognition of having fallen short in the area..
         To cover the AI technology gap, Apple has taken a multifaceted approach. High-level executives, John Giannandrea and Craig Federighi, are at the front of the effort, allocating a budget of approximately $1 billion annually to this initiative. Giannandrea is focused on developing the underlying technology for a new AI system and remaking Siri to make it more sophisticated. Federighi's software engineering group is incorporating AI into the next version of iOS.
        In addition, Apple is exploring the integration of generative AI into development tools and various apps, including Apple Music and productivity apps. The company is also thinking about deployment options for generative AI, whether it should be on-device, cloud-based, or a hybrid approach. The significance of this change is that AI is promised to be in the center of computers in a not so distant future, and Apple does not want to be left behind.
