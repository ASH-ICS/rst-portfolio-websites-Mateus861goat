        Blockchain is a ledge that works almost as a full history of transactions for Cryptocurrencies like  Bitcoin. Each new transaction that happens with the Cryptocurrency is recorded in a block, where the information gets encrypted. Each new block attaches to the last one, making a chain of blocks, hence the name Blockchain.
        The purpose of blockchain:
        Blockchain allows for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to not be regulated by a central authority, but instead to have the transactions in the currency verified by all the users, who can see all the transactions live at blockchain.com. Each computer that is connected to the the blockchain network receives a copy of the blockchain upon connecting to it. This ensures that a single individual canâ€™t change any info on the chain, since all the blockchain copies wont allow for changes to be made. 
        Blockchain in other industries:
          Currently more than 23,000 cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, but thats not all. Recently, food companies have started to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations. This can help with the prevention of food transmitted diseases like eColi.

        How does a Blockchain work?
        A blockchain is like a spreadsheet but not the exactly same. Spread sheets and block sheets used by the Block Chain are accessed and structured in different ways.
