      <td style="color:#E85A4F;"> Rugby is a sport that contains a lot of physical contact, and since players don't wear any protective gear, they always feel the full force of the hit, which can be especially dangerous with head concussions. 
          One of the only protective gear used is the mouthguard, which protects them from tooth damage and mouth lacerations and makes them look cool.
          Recently, after observing positive results in hockey, the Rugby union “World Rugby” said that they will start to introduce smart technology mouthguards to Rugby. The mouthguards will be able to measure head impacts and acceleration of a player. The data from the mouthguards will be sent to the pitch side doctors allowing them to see the impact of the hit and decide if the player should stay on or be taken off.
        World Rugby is making an investment of 2 million euros toward the support of rugby unions, clubs and competition for an adoption for the new mouthguard technologie. 
          Dr Eanna Falvey, the chief medical officer of World Rugby stated: “The latest scientific research and expert opinion is telling us one thing — reduce the forces players experience on their heads at all levels of the game. That is exactly what we’re doing.”
          She added: “The advances in smart mouthguard technology mean elite players will be better cared for than ever before. We are taking smart mouthguards out of the realm of medical research and putting them into the world of everyday performance management to continue to manage player welfare in the best way possible.”
